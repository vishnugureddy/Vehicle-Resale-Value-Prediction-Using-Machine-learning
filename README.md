Vehicle-Resale-Value-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning

ABSTRACT:
The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used vehicle based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different vehicles and models. Our results show that Random Forest model regression yield the best results than Decision Tree Regression yield and multi linear regression.

EXISTING PROBLEM:
Due to the increased price of new vehicles and the incapability of customers to buy new vehicles due to the lack of funds, used vehicle sales are on a global increase. There is a need for a used vehicle price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the vehicle using a variety of features. Though there are websites that offers this service, their prediction method may not be the best. It is important to know vehicle’s  actual market value while both buying and selling.

The project is divided into 4 parts:
1.Data Analysis
2.Building Machine learning models
3.Creating front end web application for project
4.Deployment of model By using Flask


RESULT:
Since we have to predict the price of a vehicle which is a continuous value, we have used regression technique to solve this problem. We have applied various regression algorithms as follows:

|Algorithm                |Accuracy             |Accuracy in %
|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------
|Multi Linear Regression  | 0.7132389211953192  | 71.3%
|Decision Tree Regressor  | 0.8011791920592324  | 80.1%
|Random Forest Regressor  | 0.8681639422469312  | 86.8%


CONCLUSION:
The main aim of this project is to build an accurate machine learning model which predicts the price of a used vehicle based on its features. The model is built using regression models. Out of all the three regression models used, we can conclude that Random Forest Regressor gives greater accuracy
